# Word-Counter
The Word-Counter project is a simple web application that allows users to input text and instantly see the number of characters (with and without spaces), and sentences. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it a great example of how to create an interactive and responsive web application with basic web technologies.
